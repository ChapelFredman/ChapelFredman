I am a dedicated professional with a unique journey from Mexico to Israel, driven by a passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Transitioning from military service where I excelled in QA and NOC roles, I am currently advancing my skills through rigorous training in ethical hacking and penetration testing. My educational foundation includes courses from Cisco Networking Academy, Udemy, and Harvard University, complemented by hands-on experience in server monitoring and testing for IDF web applications. I bring expertise in Python, SQL, and various testing methodologies, along with a commitment to enhancing organizational security and operational efficiency.

## Objective

I am seeking opportunities to leverage my cybersecurity training and military experience to contribute effectively as an ethical hacker and penetration tester. My goal is to apply my skills in assessing and strengthening security frameworks, conducting thorough penetration tests, and collaborating with teams to mitigate vulnerabilities. I am eager to join a dynamic organization where I can continue to learn and grow while making impactful contributions to cybersecurity initiatives.
